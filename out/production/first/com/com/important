- Java can only do PASS BY VALUE not (pass by reference)
-  primitives order: byte, char, short,int, float, long

- Function Scope: a variable declared inside a method will only be accessible to that method only
- Block Function: No need to declare the variable every time when you are modifying it.
- Loop Scope: anything which is initialized inside the loop cannot be used outside the loop but outside variables can be used inside.

- SHADOWING: Lower level is overriding the upper level
- varargs: it is used when programmer doesn't know how much input he should take
           it takes input as an array
           static void func(int ...v){
           sout(Arrays.toString(v);
           }

- ARRAY :  int[] rno=new int[5];
           int[] rno={20,30,40};

String are immutable(CANNOT BE CHANGED)
Arrays are mutable

-We use arraylist when we don't know the no. of inputs in the Array.//similar to vectors in c++
